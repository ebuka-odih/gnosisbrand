# 🧪 Media Library Testing Guide

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Radix UI SelectItem Error**
**Problem**: `SelectItem` components had empty string values (`value=""`) which is not allowed by Radix UI.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `value=""` to `value="root"` for folder selection
- Changed `value=""` to `value="none"` for category selection
- Updated backend controllers to handle these new values

### **2. Missing Vite React Plugin**
**Problem**: Dev server couldn't start due to missing `@vitejs/plugin-react`.

**Solution**: 
- Installed the missing plugin: `npm install @vitejs/plugin-react --save-dev`

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **1. Start Development Server**
```bash
cd /Users/gnosis/Herd/gnosisbrand
npm run dev
```

### **2. Access Media Library**
1. Go to: `http://gnosisbrand.test/admin/media`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Should see media library interface without console errors

### **3. Test File Upload**
1. Click "Upload Files" button
2. Select one or more image files
3. Choose folder: "Root Folder" or existing folder
4. Add tags (optional): e.g., "test, fashion"
5. Click "Upload Files"
6. Should see success message and files appear in grid

### **4. Test Search and Filters**
1. Use search box to find uploaded files
2. Use folder dropdown (should work without errors)
3. Switch between Grid/List view modes
4. Test bulk selection and operations

### **5. Test Image Picker Component**
1. Go to Products page: `http://gnosisbrand.test/admin/products`
2. Click "Add Product" 
3. In the modal, look for "Select from Library" button
4. Click it to open Image Picker
5. Should open modal with media library images
6. Select images and confirm selection

## 🔧 **Fixed Components**

### **Frontend Components**
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/admin/media.tsx`
- ✅ `resources/js/pages/admin/homepage-layout.tsx` 
- ✅ `resources/js/components/admin/image-picker.tsx`

### **Backend Controllers**
- ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/MediaController.php`
- ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/HomepageController.php`

### **Form Handling**
- ✅ Folder selection: `"root"` → empty string in backend
- ✅ Category selection: `"none"` → `null` in backend
- ✅ File upload with proper FormData handling

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **Media Library Page**
- ✅ No console errors

- ✅ File selection and upload successful
- ✅ Search and filters functional
- ✅ Grid/List view toggle works
- ✅ Bulk operations work

### **Image Picker Component**
- ✅ Opens in modal without errors
- ✅ Shows uploaded images
- ✅ Search and filter work

## 🚨 **If Issues Persist**

### **Clear Browser Cache**

Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### **Clear Laravel Cache**
```bash
